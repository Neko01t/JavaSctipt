//###Data Types

//#Primitive

// Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
// String: Represents a sequence of characters (text).
// Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
// Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
// Null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value. Itâ€™s considered an object type, but it's used to denote a null or empty reference.
// Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable identifier, often used as object property keys.
// BigInt: Represents integers with arbitrary precision, allowing the representation of numbers larger than the Number type can handle.

//#Non-Primitive

// Object: A collection of key-value pairs. Objects can be used to store more complex data structures.
// Array: A special type of object used for storing ordered collections of elements. Arrays are index-based.
//  Function: A special type of object that is callable and can execute code. Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript.
// Date: A built-in object for working with dates and times.
// RegExp: A regular expression object used for pattern matching in strings.
// Map: A collection of keyed data items, similar to an object, but keys can be of any type.
// Set: A collection of unique values of any type.
// WeakMap: A variant of Map that holds "weak" references to keys, preventing them from preventing garbage collection.
// WeakSet: A variant of Set that holds "weak" references to values, allowing for garbage collection.
// Error: Objects that represent runtime errors.
